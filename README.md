               Bamboo_Dojo: Sabaki theme From bamboo
                     since kaya is so expensive!

	
	I have no idea of playing Go but it seems to be so mentally 
	healthy that I'm making a great effort to get my sons interested
	on it. That is the main reason why I'm making a theme for 
	Sabaki. there's been much fun in making it, but I'm a lawyer, not
	a developer!.

	I started this theme with the intention of giving it some 
	oriental flavor. Maybe (hopefully) it´s not a complete shame (at
	least for occidental natives). I did not made much research and I
	have been centered on learning how to use Inkscape, how to 
	attach photos using CSS and so on. It´s a rapid prototyped
	theme, so oriental characters came from Google translator, I
	don´t even know if they are upside down,flipped or whatever, 
	sorry (only copy-paste),as I know nothing about Chinese, 
	Japanese, or Korean cultures... I hope not to be responsible of 
	any international affairs between these (or other) countries. As
	far as I know you should be capable of reading "Weiqi" in the 
	Chinese characters near the  upper bowl,"Baduk" in Korean in the 
	lower bowl, and a literally translated phrase from Spanish to 
	English to Japanese (so risky)... I suspect of the phrase to 
	have lost all of it´s meaning... only hope not to be blaming or 
	something in Japanese!. It would be nice to receive any Japanese 
	feedback so I can write something meaningful there instead. For 
	anybody interested in it, it should say "La Vida misma", in 
	English literally "Life itself", a phrase that in Spanish 
	contains both: "life and death" concepts, Chinese and Korean 
	feedback are also welcome if there's something wrong!, and if
	not... too.

	Well, music, I was looking for some Creative Commons oriental 
	style tracks and Google came up with a 20 minutes one (CHINESE
	INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) from JustVeee that looked me perfect for 
	demonstration purposes. It is also provided a  traditional 
	Chinese radio, take a look to "Sabaki.bat" or "Sabaki.bash" and 
	configure what you really want to hear. 

	I suspect that first thing my son is going to do is to copy all 
	my hard rock collection in it!, I can understand him, it is
	relaxing for me too :)	


	*****************************************************************
           Now some directions about configuring Bamboo_Dojo
	*****************************************************************

	1.- If not done yet, navigate to %appdata%/sabaki and uncompress
	the zip  there. in Linux go to ~/.config/sabaki instead.

	2.- Change the Sabaki.AppImage or sabaki.exe path if needed in
	Sabaki.sh or Sabaki.bat (Linux or Windows), check music paths
	too.

	3.- Run Sabaki by double clicking in "Sabaki_music.bat" in 
	Windows or "Sabaki.bash" in Linux, this will make Sabaki start 
	with ambient music.

	4.- If hoshi dots do something weird refer to styles.css to fix
	it.

	5.- Enjoy.

	You have two files to tweak, styles.css, and "Sabaki.bat", or 
	"Sabaki.sh" if in Linux. I´ve made an  effort for them to be 
	auto explicative, take a look.   

	If you prefer to launch Sabaki without the music stuff run it as
	usual.

	Again, as said before it's a theme made for my sons, you know 
	that I'm a lawyer playing with computers, if you run anything
	written for me and you lose data, your toaster explodes or 
	whatever is your SOLE responsibility.

	OK, that´s all, now it's time to start learning to play Go!
